#  Weather App (React + Vite)

A clean and modern weather application built with **React** and **Vite**.  
It shows real-time weather, a weekly temperature chart, and throws in sarcastic / dark Gen-Z style quotes based on current weather conditions.

This project was built to learn React **by building**, not by reading theory.
